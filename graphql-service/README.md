# GraphQL Service (Scaffold)

This module is a placeholder for future GraphQL API integration. It demonstrates how to extend the reference architecture to support GraphQL endpoints and security patterns.

## Structure
- `GraphQLController.java`: Example GraphQL query endpoint
- `GraphQLSecurityInterceptor.java`: Placeholder for GraphQL security logic

## Next Steps
- Add Spring GraphQL dependencies to your build
- Implement authentication and authorization for GraphQL queries and mutations
- Integrate with existing security modules (JWT, roles, etc.)

**This scaffold makes it easy to add GraphQL support as you continue learning.**
