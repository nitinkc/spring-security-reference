# Live API Documentation (Swagger UI)

This page provides a link to the live, interactive API documentation generated by Swagger.

**Note**: To access the Swagger UI, the Spring Boot application must be running.

## Accessing Swagger UI

1.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run -pl rest-api
    ```

2.  **Open the Swagger UI**:
    Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

    [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

This will open an interactive web page where you can explore all the API endpoints, view their details, and even send test requests directly from your browser.
